# User card
"User card" is my first task in creating a page layout on [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/?ref=challenge).

The page displays a user card with a photo, age, and city of residence. The bottom section of the card shows individual statistics on subscribers, likes and the total number of photos. The page is static, the data is provided as an example.

To view the result, click the link: [**User card**](https://user-card-efb01bv01-v0000dys-projects.vercel.app/).
